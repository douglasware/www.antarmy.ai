## Elevating Security with Microsoft Entra ID and Delegated User Authentication

Ant Army combines cutting-edge security features with user-friendly design, ensuring that data protection is both effective and unobtrusive. With Microsoft Entra ID and delegated user authentication, users can confidently engage with the platform, knowing their information is secure and under their control.

### User Context and Permissions to Prevent Oversharing
Ant Army's applications operate on behalf of signed-in users, ensuring that access is granted only to data for which they have explicit authorization. This safeguards sensitive information and minimizes the risk of unauthorized access.

### Enhanced Security Measures
Delegated authentication restricts application access to only the resources that users can access themselves. This layered security approach significantly reduces the potential for data breaches and unauthorized exposure.

### Seamless User Experience
By enabling users to log in with their existing Microsoft accounts, Ant Army streamlines the authentication process. This reduces friction and enhances overall satisfaction while maintaining robust security protocols.
